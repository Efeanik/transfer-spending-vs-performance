# Transfer Spending vs Performance in European Football (2000â€“2023)

This project explores whether football clubs that spend more in the transfer market actually achieve better results.

Using ELO ratings as a performance metric, we compare annual transfer spending with club strength over a 20+ year period. The analysis includes visual trends, correlation testing, and contextual insights about the global football economy.

All explanations and visuals are inside the Jupyter notebook.
